Welcome to my blog! I've been in the IT industry since graduating from the University of Lincoln in 2016. During that time I've gone from business systems > helpdesk > sysadmin and about everything inbetween. I've worked across multiple sectors, worked into many evenings (and nights!), and implemented basically every type of system you can imagine. 

Here is where I plan to cover the migration to a more DevOps-oriented career and I'm currently learning and implementing the following:
- Terraform
- Ansible
- GitHub Actions
- ASP.NET Core (MVC specifically)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (and eventually Kubernetes)
- OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana
- AWS/Azure

It's your typical homelab for a career blog, but hopefully a bit more sincere and fun to read!

As always, please do feel free to reach out via email.
